# Microsoft_project

This mini project is a simple button that toggles between light mode and dark mode of the web page.
This project utilizes minimal javascript, html, and css to operate. No outside technologies are needed to make operational. 
Just open it up and go click the button and once it jumps to the top right corner, click light/dark to toggle in between modes.
